    <p>Ten years ago, you would have performed each of those tasks in a completely different way (or you couldn’t perform them at all). Software seriously is eating the world really quickly. This is great 
    news for developers. Developers are the people who are capable of building stuff for a world that is becoming increasingly more reliant on technology. That’s why the demand for developers is only going 
    to increase more and more over the next ten years. The data backs this up. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, software developer jobs are expected to grow 17% from 2014 till 2024. They 
    categorize this growth as “much faster” than the average rate among other professions.</p>

            <li><b>Business technology companies,</b> like 37 Signals, Mailchimp, and Salesforce are willing to pay a lot of money for developers who can solve their core business problems.</li>
